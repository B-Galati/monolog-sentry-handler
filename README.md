[![Latest Version](https://img.shields.io/github/release/B-Galati/monolog-sentry-handler.svg?style=flat-square)](https://packagist.org/packages/bgalati/monolog-sentry-handler)
[![MIT License](https://img.shields.io/github/license/B-Galati/monolog-sentry-handler?style=flat-square)](LICENCE)

It is a [Monolog](https://github.com/Seldaek/monolog) handler for Sentry PHP SDK v2 with breadcrumbs support. 

## Features

- Send each log record to a [Sentry](https://sentry.io) server
- Send log records as breadcrumbs when they are handled in batch; the main reported log record is the one with the highest log level
- Send log along with exception when one is set in the main log record context 
- Compatible with Monolog 1 and 2
- ~~Workaround for [an issue](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-php/issues/811) that prevents sending logs in long running process~~

## Requirements

- PHP 7.1+
- [Sentry PHP SDK v2](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-php) 

## Installation

The suggested installation method is via [composer](https://getcomposer.org/):

```bash
composer require bgalati/monolog-sentry-handler
```

## Basic usage 

```php
<?php

use BGalati\MonologSentryHandler\SentryHandler;
use Sentry\State\Hub;

$sentryHandler = new SentryHandler(Hub::getCurrent());

/** @var $logger Monolog\Logger */
$logger->pushHandler($sentryHandler);

// Add records to the log
$logger->debug('Foo');
$logger->error('Bar');
```

Check out the [handler constructor](src/SentryHandler.php) to know how to control the minimum logging level and bubbling.

>to leverage Sentry breadcrumbs. It gives maximum context for each Sentry event and prevents slowing down http requests.

>Check out the symfony guide for a complete example that addresses all these points

## Customizations / Extension points

It is required to inherit from `SentryHandler` class and override these methods:

```php
<?php

use BGalati\MonologSentryHandler\SentryHandler;
use Sentry\State\Scope;

class SpySentryHandler extends SentryHandler
{
    /** {@inheritdoc} */
    protected function processScope(Scope $scope, array $record, array $sentryEvent): void
    {
        // Your custom logic like this one:
        // ....
        if (isset($record['context']['extra']) && \is_array($record['context']['extra'])) {
            foreach ($record['context']['extra'] as $key => $value) {
                $scope->setExtra((string) $key, $value);
            }
        }

        if (isset($record['context']['tags']) && \is_array($record['context']['tags'])) {
            foreach ($record['context']['tags'] as $key => $value) {
                $scope->setTag($key, $value);
            }
        }
    }

    /** {@inheritdoc} */
    protected function afterWrite(): void
    {
        // Your custom code before events are flushed
        // ...

        // Call parent method to keep default behavior or don't call it if you don't need it
        parent::afterWrite();
    }
}
```

Please look at these methods within [the code](src/SentryHandler.php) if you want more details.

## Documentation

- [Symfony guide](doc/guide-symfony.md): it gives a way to integrate this handler to your app

## FAQ

### What are the differences with the official Monolog Sentry handler?

It is pretty much the same thing but this one captures Monolog records as breadcrumbs 
when flushing in batch.

~~It provides a workaround for [issue getsentry/sentry-php#811](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-php/issues/811) which prevents sending events to Sentry in long running process.~~

Breadcrumbs support has been proposed in a pull request that has been refused for good reasons that
can be checked in the [PR](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-php/pull/844). Basically the official one aims to be as simple as possible. 

### Why symfony guide while there is an [official Symfony bundle](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-symfony)?

The symfony official bundle relies on Symfony [KernelException event](https://symfony.com/doc/current/reference/events.html#kernel-exception) 
to send event to Sentry while Symfony already cares about logging/capturing errors thanks toÂ Monolog bundle.

At the end, it's not possible to report silenced error with the bundle which can be problematic if you want to be aware 
of problems without making your app crashed.

### What about contributing it to the Monolog project?

As per this [comment](https://github.com/Seldaek/monolog/pull/1334#issuecomment-507297849), Monolog project does 
not accept new handler with 3rd party dependencies.

>For new handlers with third-party dependencies IMO the right way is to publish as a third-party package,
>with requires on monolog and on whichever dependency is needed.
>It lets Composer resolve everything which makes more sense really.
